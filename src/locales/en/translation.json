        "In March 2025, members of the Progressive Forces of Afghanistan Movement (PFAM) in Tehran orchestrated a poignant, symbolic protest against the Taliban's increasingly draconian regime. The demonstration was a quiet but powerful visual statement, featuring participants holding carefully crafted placards that highlighted specific, recent injustices.",
        "The slogans targeted new decrees such as the 'Code of Conduct,' which mandated the permanent closure of all women's bathhouses, arguing they were sites of potential moral corruption, and a directive that barred women from entering any shop selling male clothing or goods. Signs reading 'Bread, Dignity, Freedom,' 'Our Bodies Are Not Your Battlefield,' and 'You Ban, We Build' served as a direct rebuttal to the regime's attempts to systematically erase women from society.",
        "This deliberate and focused display was not meant for loud chants but for the penetrating silence of photography, creating a stark visual record of resistance that was widely disseminated to counter the Taliban's narrative of total control and compliance.",
        "The protest highlighted the Taliban's recent 'Code of Conduct' that mandated the permanent closure of women's bathhouses and barred women from shops selling male goods. These measures represent a systematic effort to erase women from public life and confine them to their homes.",
        "Through this symbolic action, PFAM members demonstrated that resistance continues despite the regime's oppressive measures, and that the voice of Afghan women cannot be silenced even through the most severe restrictions."

        "In a moving testament to her unwavering dedication, the Afghan Civil Society Organization (ACSO) extends its profound gratitude and deepest appreciation to Ms. Mawloda Tawana, the esteemed founder of the Progressive Forces of Afghanistan Movement (PFAM), for her exceptional and courageous activities throughout Pakistan in May 2023.",
        "During a period of escalating crisis, when hope was a scarce commodity for many displaced Afghans, Ms. Tawana embarked on a pivotal mission, tirelessly traveling between Islamabad, Peshawar, and Quetta to mobilize support and shine a light on the plight of those most vulnerable.",
        "She orchestrated a series of critical coordination meetings with Afghan diaspora leaders, human rights defenders, and international aid agencies, successfully establishing a vital network for channeling humanitarian assistance to refugee families facing dire conditions.",
        "Furthermore, her powerful advocacy at roundtable discussions with Pakistani civil society groups and foreign diplomats was instrumental in raising awareness about the systematic gender apartheid and human rights violations being perpetrated by the Taliban regime.",
        "Perhaps most impactful was her personal engagement with Afghan women and youth in refugee settlements, where she listened to their harrowing stories, documented human rights abuses, and, with immense compassion, helped establish underground digital literacy programs to empower them with skills for the future.",
        "The ACSO recognizes that Ms. Tawana's efforts have not only provided immediate solace and practical support to countless individuals but have also fortified the very foundations of our collective resistance, demonstrating that the spirit of Afghanistan remains unbroken."

        "The protest served as a stark reminder of the escalating violence against Afghan women under Taliban rule, highlighting specific cases of forced disappearances, arbitrary detentions, and public floggings that have become increasingly common since the regime's takeover.",
        "Ms. Tawana delivered an impassioned speech condemning the Taliban's systematic gender apartheid, drawing parallels between the struggles of women across the region and emphasizing the need for international accountability mechanisms.",
        "Protesters carried banners featuring names of Afghan women activists currently imprisoned by the Taliban and displayed symbolic empty chairs representing the millions of girls barred from schools and universities.",
        "The demonstration successfully garnered significant media attention, with Ms. Tawana giving interviews to international press outlets, ensuring that the plight of Afghan women remained visible on the global stage during this important international observance.",
        "This solidarity event strengthened cross-border alliances between Afghan and Pakistani women's rights activists, creating a unified front against religious extremism and gender-based violence in the region."

        "The participation of Ms. Mawloda Tawana, then a dedicated official within the Ministry of Education in Kabul, in the 2018 commemoration of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, was a pivotal moment that foreshadowed her future as the founder of the Progressive Forces of Afghanistan Movement (PFAM).",
        "Her presence at this official event was a testament to her deep-seated commitment to addressing the systemic injustices faced by Afghan women, a commitment forged through her firsthand experiences within the government system. Having worked on initiatives aimed at increasing girls' enrollment, she witnessed the chasm between policy promises and the grim realities on the ground.",
        "Ms. Tawana saw how cultural impediments, institutional corruption, and the rising threat of extremism consistently undermined efforts to protect women and girls. It was this profound frustration with the system's inability to enact meaningful change, coupled with her direct encounters with the stories of survivors, that crystallized her resolve.",
        "The 2018 event, rather than being a celebration of progress, highlighted for her the escalating dangers and the insufficient official response. This realization, that true advocacy required operating beyond the constraints of a compromised bureaucracy, was the crucial catalyst.",
        "The Taliban's subsequent takeover in 2021 confirmed her deepest fears and accelerated her determination, leading her to establish PFAM. The movement became the embodiment of the principle she had long advocated for: that the elimination of violence against women requires relentless, grassroots resistance."

        "The annual conference of the German Immigration Office, Church and charitable organizations was held on September 24, 2025 at the Catholic Academy in Wolfsburg.",
        "The conference was attended by representatives of the government, immigration authorities, international human rights organizations, churches and migration activists. This year's program focused on Afghanistan, Syria and China.",
        "The German government's view on migration combines legal control, humanitarian support and social integration. On one hand, Germany seeks to repatriate migrants whose asylum claims have been rejected or who have committed crimes; while on the other hand, it provides legal pathways for protection and integration opportunities for those at risk. The government's main focus is on managing legal entry, ensuring security, and respecting human rights.",
        "During a brief opportunity, I expressed the problems and pressures faced by Afghan migrants in Pakistan. I thanked the German government and people for their generous support, and finally, as a message and suggestion, I conveyed the unspoken words and sufferings of the Afghan people, especially women.",
        "Representatives of the German immigration office presented a visual report on the situation in Afghanistan, primarily based on social media and YouTube information, insisting that conditions in Afghanistan are normal and there's no risk for deporting criminals and those whose asylum has been rejected.",
        "It was deeply painful for me that they summarized the situation of the Afghan people with a few images and YouTuber reports, as if everything is well in Afghanistan. This compelled me to make a meaningful intervention and convey what was important about the situation, especially regarding Afghan women, to their attention!",
        "Another part of the conference examined the situation of asylum seekers waiting for German visas in third countries like Iran and Pakistan, emphasizing the need to address their dire conditions.",
        "In conclusion, while thanking the German government and people, I requested that they continue to stand with the Afghan people and women as always to change the current situation, and not forget the oppressed women of Afghanistan in such difficult circumstances!"
